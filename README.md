# leaf_volume

Leaf_volume includes a jupyter notebook to segment CT scans of plant buds into leaf and bud scale, 
and to calculate various properties of the leaf such as compactness, fractal dimension, leaf to bud volume ratio, etc. 
The details of the method and the analysis performed on roughly 20 buds is described in a manuscript 
submitted to BMC Bioinformatics. The manuscript will be linked here once it is accepted for publication.

## How to run the code?
We provide a conda environment file to ensure reproducability (env_bud_segment.yml). To create and activate the environment,
please give the following commands in your terminal in the bud_segment directory:
